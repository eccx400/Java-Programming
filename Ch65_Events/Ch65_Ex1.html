					<h4>Assignment:</h4>
					<p>Write an application that shows a pair of dice. When the user clicks on the 
						application window, the dice should be rolled (that is, the dice should be 
						assigned newly computed random values). In addition, the application should 
						also be able to respond to keyboard input. When the application has the input 
						focus, it should be highlighted with a colored border, and the dice should be 
						rolled whenever the user presses a key on the keyboard. This is in addition to 
						rolling them when the user clicks the mouse on the application. Here is an 
						applet that solves this exercise:</p>
					<p align="center"><APPLET height="100" width="100" code="ClickableDice2.class"> </APPLET>
					<p>The application must be declared to "<tt>implement MouseListener</tt>", and it 
						must define the <tt>mousePressed()</tt> method to roll the dice. (The other 
						methods of the <tt>MouseListener</tt> interface will be empty.) The appropriate 
						constructor must call <tt>addMouseListener(this)</tt> to register the panel to 
						listen for mouse events on itself. For example,&nbsp; the <tt>mousePressed()</tt>
						routine is defined simply as:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<pre>public void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt)
{
    roll();
}</pre>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The application also has to handle key presses, so it must implement the <tt>KeyListener</tt>
						interface, and it must register itself to listen for key events by calling <tt>addKeyListener()</tt>
						when it is constructed. The <tt>keyPressed()</tt> method just has to roll the 
						dice, by calling the same <tt>roll()</tt> subroutine that is used by the <tt>mousePressed()</tt>
						routine.</p>
					<p>The border around the dice changes from blue to red when the dice panel has the 
						input focus. In order to implement this, the application must process focus 
						events. So it needs to implement the <tt>FocusListener</tt> interface and 
						register itself to listen for focus events. A boolean-valued instance variable, <tt>
							focussed</tt>, is set to true when the applet gains the focus and to false 
						when the application loses the focus.</p>
					<p>There is one thing that is easy to forget: On some platforms, an application 
						does not automatically receive the input focus when the user clicks on it. It 
						has to request the focus by calling the <tt>requestFocus()</tt> method. This is 
						done in the <tt>mousePressed()</tt> routine, in response to a mouse click on 
						the dice panel area. If you forget this, your application will work on some 
						platforms, but on others it will never get the input focus and the keyboard 
						will never work</p>
					<p>A template application is provided which contains everything necessary for this
					   application except the event handling code.</p>
